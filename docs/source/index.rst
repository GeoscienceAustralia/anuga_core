Welcome to ANUGA's documentation!
=================================

ANUGA (pronounced "AHnooGAH") is open-source software for the simulation of the shallow water equation, 
in particular it can be used to model tsunamis and floods.

ANUGA is a python 3 package with some C and Cython extensions (and an optional fortran extension).

ANUGA is developed at Geoscience Australia, Mathematical Sciences Institute 
at the Australian National University and volunteers.

Althought ANUGA was created in a collaboration by Geoscience Australia 
and Mathematical Sciences Institute at the Australian National University, 
it is now developed and maintained by a community of volunteers.
