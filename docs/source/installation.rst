Introduction
------------

ANUGA is a python package with some C extensions (and an optional fortran 
extension). This version of ANUGA is run and tested using python 3.7 - 3.9


Dependencies
------------

ANUGA requires python 3.X (X>6) and the following python packages:

.. code-block::

  numpy scipy matplotlib pytest cython netcdf4 dill future gdal \
  pyproj pymetis triangle Pmw mpi4py pytz ipython  meshpy Pmw pymetis utm

ANUGA is developed on Ubuntu and so we recommend Ubuntu as your production environment
(though ANUGA can be installed on MacOS and Windows using `Miniconda` or `MiniForge`) 

Ubuntu Install with MiniForge3
------------------------------

A clean way to install the dependencies for ANUGA is to use Anaconda, 
or Miniconda Python distributions by Continuum Analytics. 

Using a `conda` installation has the advantage of allowing you to create multiple 
python environments and is particularly 
useful if you want to keep multiple versions of ANUGA

Indeed the most stable install is via the `conda-forge` channel
which is easily available using the Miniforge. In particular the installation of 
the `gdal` and `mpi4py` modules are more stable. 

These conda environments do not require administrative rights 
to your computer and do not interfere with the Python installed in your system. 

Install the latest version of `Miniforge` from  https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge or
use, for instance, `wget` to download the latest version via:

.. code-block:: bash

    wget -O Miniforge3.sh "https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh"
    bash Miniforge3.sh


If you don't have `wget` you can install it via: 

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get update -q
    sudo apt-get install wget git
    
Once `Miniforge` is installed, we can now create an environment to run `anuga'. 
    
Create a conda environment `anuga_env` (or what ever name you like):

.. code-block:: bash

    conda update conda
    conda create -n anuga_env python=3.8 anuga mpi4py
    conda activate anuga_env

Note we have also installed `mpi4py` to allow anuga to run in parallel. 
On some systems you may need to manually install `mpi4py` to match the version of `mpi` you are using.


This has setup a `conda` environment for `anuga` using python 3.8. (`anuga` has be tested on 3.7, 3.8. 3.9.)    

We are now ready to use `anuga'. 

You can test your installation via:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -c "import anuga; anuga.test()"




Ubuntu Install with MiniForge3 and pip
--------------------------------------

Once you have a python environment it is also possible to install `anuga` via `pip`:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install anuga

You might need to run this command twice to push `pip` to install all the dependencies. And indeed 
you will need to install `gdal` and `mpi4py` manually. 

You can test your installation via:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -c "import anuga; anuga.test()"


Ubuntu Install with MiniForge3 from github
------------------------------------------

Alternatively you can the most current version of `anuga`` from GitHub

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/anuga-community/anuga_core.git
    cd anuga_core
    pip install -e .
    python runtests.py 

Remember, to use ANUGA you will have to activate the `anuga_env` environment 
via the command:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    conda activate anuga_env`

You might even like to set this up in your `.bashrc` file. 

Installing GDAl on Ubuntu using apt and pip
-------------------------------------------

ANUGA can be installed using `pip`, but a complication arise when installing 
the `gdal` package. 

First set up a python virtual environment and activate  via:

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 -m venv anuga_env
    course anuga_env/bin/activate

Now we first need to install the `gdal` python package. First install the 
gdal library, via:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt-get install -y gdal-bin libgdal-dev

We need to ascertain the version of  `gdal` installed using the following command: 

.. code-block:: bash

    ogrinfo --version

THe version of `gdal` to install via `pip` should match the version of the library. 
For instance on Ubuntu 20.04 the previous command produces:

.. code-block:: bash

    GDAL 3.0.4, released 2020/01/28

So in this case we install the `gdal` python package as follows

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install gdal==3.0.4

Now we complete the installation of `anuga` simply by:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install anuga

If you obtain errors from `pip` regarding "not installing dependencies", it seems that that can be fixed by just 
running the `pip install anuga` again

Installing on Ubuntu using apt and pip
---------------------------------------

You can install the `anuga` dependencies via a  combination of the 
standard ubuntu ``apt`` method and python pip install.

From your home directory run the following commands which will download anuga 
to a directory `anuga_core`, install dependencies, install anuga and run the unit tests:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/anuga-community/anuga_core.git
    sudo bash anuga_core/tools/install_ubuntu_20_04.sh

Note: Part of the bash shell will run as 
sudo so will ask for a password. If you like you can run the package installs manually, 
run the commands in the script ``anuga_core/tools/install_ubuntu_20._04.sh``. 

This script also creates a python3 virtual environment `anuga_env`. You should activate this 
virtual environment when working with `anuga`, via the command:

.. code-block:: bash

    source ~/anuga_env/bin/activate

You might like to add this command to your `.bashrc` file to automatically activate this 
python environment. 

Updating
~~~~~~~~

From time to time you might like to update your version of anuga to the latest version on 
github. You can do this by going to the `anuga_core` directory and `pulling` the latest
version and then reinstalling via the following commands:
 
.. code-block:: bash

  cd anuga_core
  git pull
  pip install -e .

And finally check the newinstallation by running the unit tests via:
.. code-block:: bash

  python runtests.py -n 
      

Windows 10 Install using 'Ubuntu on Windows'
--------------------------------------------

Starting from Windows 10, it is possible to run an Ubuntu Bash console from Windows. 
This can greatly simplify the install for Windows users. 
You'll still need administrator access though. First install an ubuntu 20_04 subsystem. 
Then just use your preferred ubuntu install described above. 



Windows Installation using MiniForge
------------------------------------

We have installed `anuga` on `windows` using miniforge.  

You can download MiniForge manually 
from the MiniForge site https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge:

Alternatively you can download and install miniforge via CLI commands:

Run the following powershell instruction to download miniforge. 

.. code-block:: bash

    Start-FileDownload "https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-Windows-x86_64.exe" C:\Miniforge.exe; echo "Finished downloading miniforge"
  
From a standard `cmd` prompt then install miniconda via:

.. code-block::  bash

    C:\Miniconda.exe /S /D=C:\Py
    C:\Py\Scripts\activate.bat
    
Install conda-forge packages:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create -n anuga_env python=3.8  anuga mpi4py
    conda activate anuga_env
    
You can test your installation via:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -c "import anuga; anuga.test()"
