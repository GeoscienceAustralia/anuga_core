PyMetis provides a python module interface to the Metis graph
partitioning and sparse matrix ordering library.

Currently only the METIS_PartMeshNodal function is implemented.

Build instructions:
Linux:
run "make" in the top pymetis directory.

Should the metis version change, the new metis package should be in a new
subdirectory. Metis 4.0 is in metis-4.0

The METIS_DIR= line in the makefile will need to be changed appropriately.

64 bit users need to run `make COPTIONS="-fPIC"'

Windows:
Required: MinGW compiler, Cygwin utilities (Bash, cp, [).

Run:

make for_win32

Other makefile targets:
clean:
removes all intermediate files.

realclean:
performs clean, then also removes the pymetis.so file.
