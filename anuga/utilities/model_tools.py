 FILE :  MODEL_BUILD_TOOLS_04.py
 DATE:  28/05/2013
 
 Last Change:  Can now define directories by using underscore _ 
 so mannings = 0_05



This script is meant to work with a set of standardised directories so that an ANUGA model script
can be kept extremely minimalist, this module provides functions that will semi-automate the population
of polygons and attributes to:

1. define MESH Refinement
2. define Variation in ROughness in the model
3. define the additional of buildings of various heights
4. define rainfall spatial variation via polygons

To ensure these functions operate it is important to use the
STANDARD_MODEL_CREATE_SCRIPT that will create a set of standardised directories to store model data

The concept is to populate this standard directory structure with the required 'csv' files 
describing the required polygons.

MESH REFINE
EG: c:\Model\Data\Mesh_Refine\10000 and c:\Model\Data\Mesh-Refine\1000
Contain the polygons that describe the mesh refine for triangles no larger 
than 10,000m2 and 1,000m2

BUILDINGS
Similarly buildings within numbered building directories will signify the building height
EG: c:\Model\Data\Buildings\8  and c:\Model\Data\Buildings\12
will contain polygons to describe buildings that are 8 and 12 metres high

ROUGHNESS
The directory structure will be based on identifying for example the roughness directory
under which numbered directories will signify the rougness value.
EG: c:\Model\Data\Roughness\100 and c:\Model\Data\Roughness\10
will contain polygons top describe surface roughness in the model of 0.100 and 0.010

RAINFALL
EG: c:\Model\Data\Rainfall_Polys\Gauge_name_01 and c:\Model\Data\Rainfall_Polys\Gauge_name_02
Will list the polygons that apply rainfall described by the raingauge files in the directory name
options: Either the directory Name is the Raingauge file name, or the Raingauge file (with extension tms) 
is located in the directory and associated with the polygons in the same directory.... or
the raingauge is kept in another directory under FORCEFUNC and there is a pointer to it ???

TO BE RESOLVED 

METHOD OF CALLING:
Identify the directory in which sub directories will appear that have names as numeric values

USAGE FOR REFINE (example):
mesh_refine_directory =join('POLYS','Cycleway')
mesh_refine_defined = get_REFINE_polygon_value_list(mesh_refine_directory) # Returns List of Polygons and Value from Directory Name
print 'Mesh Refine Definitions in Directory....'
print mesh_refine_defined
# Need to Reverse the Lists so that mesh Refine is applied from Coarse to Fine. As default directory read is from smallest to largest number....
mesh_refine_defined.reverse()
print 'Mesh Refine REVERSED HERE....'
#mesh_refine_reversed = mesh_refine_defined.reverse()
print mesh_refine_defined


buildings_directory =join('02POLYS','04_BLDGS')
buildings_defined = get_BUILDING_polygon_value_list(buildings_directory)

such that all polygons under a directory named 45, under directory:- 04_BLDGS  will be assigned a height of 4.5m

Need to add the following lines to Scripts:
