  ANUGA is a free and open source software tool for
  hydrodynamic modelling, suitable for predicting the
  consequences of hydrological disasters such as riverine
  flooding, storm surges and tsunamis. For example, ANUGA
  can be used to create predicted inundation maps based on
  hypothetical tsunami or flood scenarios.
