What is ANUGA?
--------------

ANUGA (pronounced "AHnooGAH") is open-source software for the simulation of
the shallow water equation, in particular it can be used to model tsunamis
and floods.

ANUGA is a python package with some C extensions (and an optional
fortran extension). ANUGA is in the process of being ported to python 3. To test the 
python 3 version of ANUGA clone anuga_core from `anuga-community`
