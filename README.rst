What is ANUGA?
--------------

ANUGA (pronounced "AHnooGAH") is open-source software for the simulation of
the shallow water equation, in particular it can be used to model tsunamis
and floods.

ANUGA is a python 3 package with some C and Cython extensions (and an optional
fortran extension). The python 3 version of ANUGA will continue to be developed 
and be available from this `anuga-community` repository. 

The old python 2.7 version of ANUGA is available from https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/anuga_core

Althought ANUGA was created in a collaboration by Geoscience Australia and Mathematical Sciences Institute at the
Australian National University, it is now developed and maintained by a community of volunteers.
