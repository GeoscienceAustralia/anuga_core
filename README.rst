What is ANUGA?
--------------

ANUGA (pronounced "AHnooGAH") is open-source software for the simulation of
the shallow water equation, in particular it can be used to model tsunamis
and floods.

ANUGA is a python package with some C extensions (and an optional
fortran extension). At present ANUGA has not been ported to python 3.
We recommend using python 2.7

Developed at Geoscience Australia and Mathematical Sciences Institute at the
Australian National University.
